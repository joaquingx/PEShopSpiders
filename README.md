# ShopSpiders

## Pull Requests

### Spider output
PR must include spider(s) output(s), for that, you should add your output in `ShopSpiders/ShopSpiders/spiders_output` folder.

Name convention is `spider_name` + `_` + `branch_name.json` e.g. `metro` spider in branch `add-spider-metro` output should've named: `metro_add-spider-metro.json`.

Also, any spider update should replace last output of its spider.

### Workflow

- Be descriptive in your commit message.
- `rebase` before PR, and `squash` if it's necessary.
